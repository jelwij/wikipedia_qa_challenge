# POP Wikipedia QA Challenge 

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to tackle this coding challenge. Weâ€™re all very excited to see how you approach the problems weâ€™ve set out for you. ðŸ’ª

If you havenâ€™t used Cypress before, donâ€™t worry. You can check out Cypress' thorough and really helpful documentation [here](https://docs.cypress.io/) and we've also left the example tests in the repository `cypress/integration/examples` to help guide you. 

There are 9 challenges in `cypress/integration/wikipedia_qa_challenge.js` which test some of Wikipedia's functionality. The challenges have been written as comments in the file. We have completed the first 3, and would like you to complete as many of the remaining 6 as you can. 

If you have any questions, please contact [David Sigley](mailto:david@iampop.com) or [myself](tristan@iampop.com). 

## Steps to load test locally:
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/yeniv/qa_wikipedia_challenge.git`
2. Run `yarn` from your command line interface to install the cypress dependancy
3. Run `yarn run cypress open` to open the Cypress app (run each time as you update your specs, so stop/start Cypress as necessary)
4. Open and complete the challenges in â€˜cypress/integration/wikipedia_qa_challenge.jsâ€™

Good luck ðŸŽ‰
